# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health parameters of patients. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## How It Works
- Loads patient data containing features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.
- Performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- Trains a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) to classify if a patient has heart disease.
- Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and classification reports.

## Libraries Used

- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
